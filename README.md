A light weight Corona+Lua skeleton for game jams/compos

This is a lightweight skeleton that is intended to make it a bit easier to get a game jam entry up and going with CoronaSDK. It has a simple text based menu scene, a game scene where you can choose from a simple "world" organization of displayObjects or easily load in a tiled .JSON map as your world.
